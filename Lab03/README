We implemented Part 3 (Degree Distribution Information) as part of our buildGraphs program.

The algorithm implemented in Part 4 (Word Association Chains) works for both undirected and directed
graphs.

After compiling the files...

To run both parts 1 & 3 run:

java buildGraphs wordgame_20170721.csv

This creates the directed and undirected graps and outputs them to CSV files.


To run part 2 enter:

java Connected <undirected graph file name>


To run part 4 enter:

java WordChains wordgame_20170721.csv <file containing vertex pairs>

After the prompt, enter 0 to use an undirected graph or 1 to use a directed graph.


To run part 5 enter:

java Bacon wordgame_20170721.csv

Part 5 chooses the 5 vertices (or less than 5 if the graph has less than 5 vertices)
that have an edge with the highest number of different vertices
